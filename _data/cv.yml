      institution: Amazon, Tempe, USA
      year: May 2023 - Aug 2023
      description:
        - Designed the architecture for Brand Customer Reviews (BCR) Auto Reply that establishes contact between a seller and the buyer of the product with critical reviews, automatically in an event-driven fashion with an AWS CICD pipeline.
        - Reduced average latency from 200 ms to 2 ms on Opensearch queries used by BCR Auto Reply architecture.
        - Handled the Migration of existing BCR architecture with detailed documentation and roll-back plan for all regions.
        - Implementation of BCR Auto Reply architecture with S3 Bucket, AWS SQS Queue, AWS Serverless Lambda, AWS Dynamo database, and Elastic search with complete code coverage through unit tests and Integration tests in JAVA.
        - Projected to benefit 1000+ customers over a sum of $100k on a monthly basis as they used a paid third-party tool to automate this before. The total cost for this feature on Amazon's end is $200 monthly with the optimized architecture.

      description:
        - Designed, and developed a Data Ingestion pipeline using API first approach. FastAPI docker images deployed on Google Cloud Run for autoscaling, Google Datastore as a decoupling layer, and time series support. 90% reduction in operations.
        - Enabled 20% faster data ingestion by clients (~20M entries daily) with an 80% increase in frequency, and 90% reduction in MySQL database CRUD functionality using delta updates based on time series data.
        - Prepared system architecture and implemented a real-time scalable Data Processing pipeline, an event-driven, push-based architecture with a priority queue. Used RabbitMQ clusters, Redis, Google Kubernetes Engine, KEDA, AWS Lambda, and Google Cloud Run for a scalable processing pipeline. The pipeline is 20% faster than previous and has achieved a 40% cost reduction to $0.0001 per product .
        - Semi-Supervised Text Classification, NER, and Text Generation with Transformers in Fashion space. Fine-tuned BERT with MLM and GPT2 with CLM with 15 Million fashion sentences and released the language models for downstream tasks.
        - Improved and implemented a Transformers-based Text Classification pipeline that used a fine-tuned BERT model as a base layer with 72 classes and achieved 98% model accuracy, and 95% real-world accuracy.
